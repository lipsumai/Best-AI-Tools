name: TruVerifAI
description: TruVerifAI is a multi-model intelligence platform that queries four AI models simultaneously—one each from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and xAI—to deliver complete, verified responses from multiple model perspectives. The platform directly addresses the persistent problems of model blind spots and hallucinations by aggregating responses across models, surfacing areas of agreement and divergence, and verifying claims through web search and cross-model analysis.
